# Hummifier

My capstone project for WGU 2024. Course C964. It's finally here. The last one.

The purpose of this project is to identify the hummingbirds that fly up to local feeders. To know what kind of 
hummingbirds are in the area and keep track of how often they are coming to those food sources. The model and 
application will be able to identify hummingbirds in photos and images that are fed to it. The images will be saved in
folders or a database or file as well as statistics on the species and their visits. Time of day and how long it stayed. 
Reports can be run to get a number of visits per day per species.
